This is a highly experimental little app, designed mostly as a testing ground. It's a complete mess at the moment and should not be used as a guide for how to structure a Pine app. Instead, it's being used to *find* what that structure should look like and to figure out where Pine needs more work.

It also uses the Nuke library for some CSS-in-haxe styles.
